# ComPylon
This is a script that performs Lexicographic Syntactical for an educational programming Language eel implemented on Python 2.7.

This project was done in order to get the hang of how a compiler reads the code.

### How to test it
You can read the source code and find out what are the rules for that language.
Try to modify the examples eel files in order to get the proper error message everytime.

## Run from terminal

``` python lexsynt.py "example2.eel"```
